Insurance Claim Fraud Detection Dashboard

An interactive machine learning dashboard that predicts whether insurance claims are fraudulent or legitimate, providing decision support for adjusters and risk managers.

Built with Python, Scikit-learn, Streamlit, Pandas, and NumPy, this project demonstrates the application of data analytics in the insurance and risk management industry by leveraging supervised learning models to enhance claims processing accuracy.

🔍 Features

Fraud Classification: Classifies claims as fraudulent or legitimate using trained ML models.

Interactive Dashboard: Built with Streamlit, enabling adjusters to input claim details and instantly receive fraud risk predictions.

Model Performance: Achieved 85%+ accuracy using Random Forest and Logistic Regression.

Data-Driven Insights: Leverages historical claims data for training and evaluation.

Scalable Design: Modular code structure for experimenting with different models and datasets.

📌 Example Use Case

An insurance adjuster receives a claim. Instead of manually screening for inconsistencies, they input the claim details into the dashboard. The ML model instantly outputs a fraud risk classification, helping prioritize further investigation and saving significant time.

🌍 Background & Relevance

This project reflects my interest in bridging computer science, data analytics, and risk management.

As a Fisk Experiential Summer Learning Program Intern, I gained exposure to underwriting, claims, and actuarial science.

I also earned the Certified Insurance Service Representative (CISR) designation, strengthening my knowledge of property and casualty exposures.

By integrating these experiences with machine learning, I built this dashboard to showcase how AI can support insurers in mitigating fraud risks and improving claims operations.

📌 Future Improvements

Deploying the app on cloud platforms for broader accessibility

Expanding dataset size for improved generalization

Adding explainable AI (XAI) features to interpret model predictions

Testing ensemble and deep learning models
