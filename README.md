💼 Insurance Claim Fraud Detection Dashboard

An interactive machine learning dashboard that predicts whether insurance claims are fraudulent or legitimate, providing decision support for adjusters and risk managers.

Built with Python, Scikit-learn, Streamlit, Pandas, and NumPy, this project demonstrates the application of data analytics in the insurance and risk management industry by leveraging supervised learning models to enhance claims processing accuracy.

🔍 Features

Fraud Classification → Classifies claims as fraudulent or legitimate using trained ML models.
Interactive Dashboard → Built with Streamlit, enabling adjusters to input claim details and instantly receive fraud risk predictions.
Model Performance → Achieved 85%+ accuracy using Random Forest and Logistic Regression.
Data-Driven Insights → Leverages historical claims data for training and evaluation.
Scalable Design → Modular code structure for experimenting with different models and datasets.
